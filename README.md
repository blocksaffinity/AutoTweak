 # __AutoTweak__ is a revolutionary tweaking software made by @blocksaffinity in [𝐛𝐥𝐱 Tweaks](https://discord.gg/jVKjDQSuQc):
 
 The main idea of __AutoTweak__ is to be able to apply hundreds to thousands of tweaks with the click of a button. 
 Normally, you would have to spend a while toggling swtiches and wondering whether you should turn this one on or not.
 ### __AutoTweak__ changes this. 

 You can view the full range of tweaks availiable using this invite: https://discord.gg/jVKjDQSuQc

 Good luck fellow tweakers!
